# Markdown Master

Welcome. This is the master folder of all my Markdown notes for the past, present, and future.

It's designed to easily allow me to publish new notes to my blog, create good looking PDFs, and create solutions that easily navigate and search notes for different classes, projects, and observations.

This note contains the overall file structure.
