# Stress

It's not just what you feel when you're 10 days behind in your lectures, desperately struggling to catch up. Stress is a force per unit area. In a differential material element, the stresses may be characterized as a tensor:

The subscripts on the normal stresses $\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z$ refer to the axis those stresses lie parallel with. The first subscript on the shear stresses $\tau$ refers to the face along which that stress lies, and the second subscript indicates the direction along that face.

Since the element is in static equilibrium, the moments created by the stresses acting on each face of the element must cancel each other out. Therefore,

$$
\tau_{yx} = \tau_{xy} \hspace{2em}
\tau_{yz} = \tau_{zy} \hspace{2em}
\tau_{zx} = \tau_{xz} \hspace{2em}
$$

Tensile stresses are positive stresses, and shear stresses are positive if they act in the positive direction of a reference axis (arrows point in the positive direction in the diagram). The negative faces of the shear stress component have shear stresses actign in the opposite direction; these are also positive.

It's more usual to see a 2D "slice" of a shear stress component:

The sense of the shear components is specified by the clockwise or counterclockwise convention: $\tau_{xy}$ is ccw and 
$\tau_{yx}$ is cw.

# Mohr's Circle

If you cut the 2d shear component @fig-2d-shear with an oblique plane at angle $\phi$ to the x-axis, you see resultant shears $\sigma$ and $\tau$ acting on the cut plane.

Assuming a unit cross-section, you can sum the forces to 0:

$$
\begin{gather}
\sigma \, ds\, \sin (\phi) + \tau\,ds\,\cos(\phi) +  \tau_{xy}\, dx + \sigma_y \, dy = 0
\sigma\,ds\,\cos(\phi) + \tau\,ds\,\sin(\phi) + \tau_{yx}\,dx + \sigma_y\,dy = 0
\end{gather}
$$
