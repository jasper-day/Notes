Hydrodynamics is fully defined by these factors:

Mass density $\rho$, speed $\nu$, pressure $p$, viscosity $\mu$, and the acceleration due to gravity $g$.

Take for example the capillary effect:

| Symbol | Description | Base Dimensions |
|---|---|---|
| $h$ | Distance water is drawn into the tube | $L$ |
| $d$ | Diameter of the tube | $L$ |
| $\sigma$ | Surface tension of the water | $MT^{-2}$ |
| $\rho$ | Mass density of water | $ML^{-3}$ |
| $g$ | Acceleration due to gravity | $LT^{-2}$ |

$h$ is some function of the other three quantities:

$$
h = f\left( d, \sigma, \rho, g \right)
$$

Then 

$$
\textbf{A} = \begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 0 & -3 & 1 \\
    0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\
    0 & -2 & 0 & -2 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

The null space of $\textbf{A}$ is linear combinations of the vector $\left(-2, 1, -1, 1\right)$

Therefore 

$$
h = d \cdot g\left(\frac{\sigma g}{d^{2}p}\right)
$$
