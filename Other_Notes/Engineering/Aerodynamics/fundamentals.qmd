# Vector Relations

## Coordinate Systems

We have three common orthogonal coordinate systems: cartesian, cylindrical, and spherical.

### Cartesian Coordinate System

Cartesian coordinates in 3D space are defined by three mutually perpendicular unit vectors **i, j,** and **k**, which lie along the $x$, $y$, and $z$ axes respectively. An arbitrary point $P$ in space is located by specifying the three coordinates $(x,y,z)$. The point also has position vector 

$$
\textbf{r} = x\ \textbf{i} + y\ \textbf{j} + z\ \textbf{k}
$$

It's bog-standard. Everyone and their mother has been working in Cartesian coordinates since grade school.
