1. Focusing on Caltech, explain your acadeic motivations for applying for an exchange.
    1. The course work at Caltech is some of the most rigorous in the world. I want to learn the most I can about engineering, and I want to learn it as efficiently as possible. 
2. Elaborate on the qualities you have which would make you a good representative for the University of Edinburgh, citing examples from your extracurricular activities.
    1. After one year in the program, I've risen to become the Structures and Recovery lead of the university's rocketry team. In my first year, I designed many of the critical structural subsystems that allowed our rocket to reach a 7,000 meter apogee, as well as a unique mechanical airbraking system.
    2. I'm currently the Structures and Recovery lead of the rocketry team, meaning I'm in charge of 10 engineers who design and build rockets from the ground up. In my capacity as leader, not only have I created and vetted technical designs and the output of many people, but I've had to organize meetings in large groups, I've given workshops on rocketry design, and I'm in charge of managing the procurement of rocket parts with a â‚¤5,000 budget.
    3. I'm highly organized and efficient, capable of learning large quantities of information in a short amount of time. Over the summer, I worked full-time as a lead teacher in a STEM summer camp, showing kids how to work with Arduinos, design their own automated projects, and write code for video games. On top of this, I worked another 10 hours a week tutoring various clients. I taught courses ranging from high school level math and chemistry to advanced undergraduate linear algebra, and I did all this without missing a single day of work or tutoring session.
3. Explain how this opportunity would benefit you from a personal perspective.
    1. Taking a semester at Caltech would allow me to demonstrate my ability to overcome significant academic challenges.
        1. I've spent my first three terms at University of Edinburgh overloading my learning into as much content as possible. I learned a full semester course of Linear Algebra through the MIT open courseware, to the point where I was able to tutor a 3rd year engineer in the subject over the summer. I've also had to learn immense amounts of content to be able to lead rocket design: the aerodynamics of objects in ballistic flight, structural analysis of complex anisotropic composite materials, classical mechanics and control systems. 
    2. Taking courses at Caltech would make my designs better, more complete, and more stable.
