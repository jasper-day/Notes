It is often desirable to see where a function of one or many variables achieves a particular value, a local maximum, or an inflection point. This can be done analytically for simple functions like small polynomials and trigonometric functions, but analytic solutions to higher-degree polynomials or nonlinear equations are usually impossible to find. 

They can, however, be solved numerically.

Consider a function whose desired values occur at $f(x) = 0$ (any function with a desired value may be put in this form). We use computer programs to determine the roots of this function.
