This chapter presents applications of the equations of rigid body motion to the study of the attitude dynamics of satellites. Spinning a satellite around its axis is a very simple way to keep the vehicle pointed in a desired direction. The chapter presents spin-stabilized spacecraft, the stability of a spinning satellite to show that only oblate spinners are stable over long times, some of the common means of changing the attitude or motion of a spacecraft by applying external or internal forces or torques, and how the earth's gravitational Ô¨Åeld by itself can stabilize the attitude of large satellites such as the space shuttle or space station in low earth orbits.}
