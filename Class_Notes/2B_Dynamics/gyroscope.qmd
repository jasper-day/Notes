# Introduction

<!-- In no more than 200 words explain the purpose of the experiment and why gyroscopes are important -->

Gyroscopes are devices found in most large vehicles, including boats, airplanes, and spaceships. At its core, a gyroscope is a spinning mass, often balanced on gimbals. Since gyroscopes stay stationary in an inertial reference frame, they can be used to calibrate navigational systems. Further, an applied torque will cause a gyro to precess in a direction 90Â° offset to the applied torque, with application in attitude control and balance.

Gyroscopes are used to adjust the attitude of sattelites: when the satellite applies a torque to its gyroscope, the gyroscope applies an equal and opposite torque to the satellite, allowing its attitude to be adjusted without throwing mass overboard. [@CURTIS2010573].

Gyroscopes have also been used for fun. They're sold as childrens' toys, and can serve as toys for academics and roboticists as well. Reference @7508999 create a unicycle balancing robot, which uses the precession of two symmetric flywheels to maintain its balance. A simple feedback loop (combined with understanding of gyroscope dynamics) allows their robot to balance.
