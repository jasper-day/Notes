<td class="rowhead1">Summary</td><td colspan="99">This course introduces students to a wide range of skills that are required in civil/mechanical engineering design, and that make part of the engineers' toolbox. It provides students with experience of solving and communicating solutions to open-ended engineering problems that require compromise between competing criteria and priorities. It develops competence and confidence in communication skills including sketching, engineering drawings and oral presentation. It also introduces engineering tools such as basic CAD and spreadsheet skills via self-directed learning.</td>

    Engineers design things. The 'things' that engineers design range from mile-high skyscrapers to underwater vehicles, from flood prevention schemes for informal settlements, to wind turbines, from single use PPE for hospitals to 100-year city strategies. We design things that need to fit into and strengthen our existing infrastructure. Engineering, therefore, is fundamentally creative, and Tools for Engineering Design 2 helps develop the skills needed for Engineering Design.<br/>
<br/>
A key aspect of design is that there are no single correct answers. It is relatively straightforward to come up with a solution that works; the challenge for a good designer is to come up with the 'best' solution. That is not straightforward: some solutions might be impractical or unsafe to build, some might use materials that cannot be found locally, some will be very expensive or poor aesthetically. Designers often work with incomplete information, a Client who changes their mind part way through the project, or contradicting requirements. Iteration is always needed to find the 'best' design solution.<br/>
<br/>
Tools for Engineering Design 2 helps students develop a 'toolbox' of strategies for tackling open-ended design problems. The course introduces the challenges of iterative design through short group projects and tasks. The projects gradually build students' awareness of and confidence in tackling conceptual design problems, a thread that is fundamental through engineering degree programmes. <br/>
<br/>
The course covers:<br/>
- What is design?<br/>
- Communication (drawings, group work, meetings, discussion)<br/>
- Self-led learning exercises<br/>
- Design, build, re-design project<br/>
- Master planning project<br/>
- Upgrade project<br/>
- Reflection exercise on what you have learnt on this course. <br/>
<br/>
As well as learning about the design process, students learn specific skills required by a designer: how drawings can be used at different stages of design; good team-working practices; and using simple tools to optimise solutions.<br/>
<br/>
The course is taught through project work with discussion and critique of the various projects providing feedback to develop students' design skills.<br/>
