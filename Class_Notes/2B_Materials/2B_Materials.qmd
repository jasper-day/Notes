<td class="rowhead1">Summary</td><td colspan="99">Materials are at the core of all disciplines of engineering. Engineers are better engineers when they have an awareness and understanding of the properties of materials. Science gives us a   framework for understanding materials, within which we can include all classes of materials, hence to some extent unifying the treatment of metals, ceramics, polymers and composites. This is    materials science. At the heart of materials science is    microstructure, which characterises the internal architecture of substances. A   description of the composition and internal architecture of materials gives us a  basis for understanding engineering properties. Developing a broad knowledge of the underpinning science of materials, and how this links with properties, enables you to apply these concepts in engineering. This involves thinking carefully, discerning key concepts in    a particular situation, and beginning to appreciate the complexities, subtleties and ambiguities that arise when dealing with materials. This skill set is part of your development as a   problem solving engineer.</td>
