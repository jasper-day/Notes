<td class="rowhead1">Summary</td><td colspan="99">Sensing and data analysis is fundamental to all Engineering disciplines. It  relies  on  a  key  understanding  of  sensor  networks  and  how  they  communicate,    resource    and    computation    constraints,    and    an    understanding of how data is sampled and then analysed. Signals are the output of sensors which have measured data, and this course gives an introduction to key signal analysis concepts. <br/>
<br/>
This course aims to introduce students to the fundamentals of Sensor Networks, Signal Processing, Communication, and Information Theory. The course aims to provide an insight into time domain and frequency domain analysis of continuous-time signals, and provide an insight into the  sampling  process  and  properties  of  the  resulting  discrete-time signals.    The    course    then    introduces    the    students    to    basic    communication  modulation  techniques,  as  well  as  probability  theory  for  analysing  random  signals.  At  the  end  of  the  module  students  will  have acquired sufficient expertise in these concepts to appreciate how sensor  networks  and  signal  analysis  can  be  used  in  a  variety  of  disciplines.</td>

    1.  Course  overview,  introduction  to  sensor  networks  and  their  roles  in  Engineering disciplines. Introduction of sensor types, sensor outputs, sensor networks,  sensor  signals.  Introduction  to  the  role  of communications  in  sensor networks.<br/>
2. An introduction to the broader topic of signal processing, machine learning, and the role of these disciplines within Data Science. Considers applications of machine learning for detection, classification, segmentation, regression on signals received from sensor networks.<br/>
3.  Nature  of,  and  types  of  signals;  definitions  of  continuous  time,  discrete  time, periodic, aperiodic, deterministic and random. Introduction to phasors and   concept   of   frequency   of   single   tone,   typical   signals   and   signal   classification, power and energy.<br/>
4. Signal decompositions and concept of signal building blocks.<br/>
5.  An  overview  of  spectral  analysis  techniques  in  general.  Discussion  of  the  role of Fourier Analysis, including trigonometric and complex Fourier series, Fourier transforms, Parseval's theorem, physical interpretations, and plotting spectra.<br/>
6.  The  Discrete-time  world:  Developing  Nyquist's  Sampling  Theorem  and  Discrete-Time Signals.<br/>
7.  An  overview  of  communication  theory:  how  data  from  sensors  can  be  transmitted from the source to a remote receiver/sink for further processing or   use. This will include: AM/FM/PM, OOK, FSK, and PSK.<br/>
8.  Multiplexing  techniques:  Methods  of  combining  signals  from  multiple  sensors   for   transmission   over   a   common   medium.   This   will   include:      Frequency Division Multiplexing and Time Division Multiplexing.<br/>
9. Basic Information theory.
