# The Particular Integral

The general form of an inhomogeneous linear constant coefficient DE is:

$$
\begin{align}
L[x] &= a_{p} \frac{d^px}{dt^p} + a_{p-1} \frac{d^{p-1}x}{dt^{p-1}} + a_{p-2} \frac{d^{p-2}x}{dt^{p-2}} + ... \\
&+ a_{2} \frac{d^{2}x}{dt^{2}} + a_{1} \frac{d^{1}x}{dt^{1}} + a_{0} \frac{d^{0}x}{dt^{0}} = f(t)
\end{align}
$${#eq-general-form}

where $L[x]$ is a $p$-th order differential operator.

:::{#thm-inhomog}

Let

$$
L[x] = f(t)
$${#eq-first}

be an*inhomogeneous* linear differential equation. If $x^*$ is any solution of @eq-first, and $x_c$ is a solution of the equivalent *homogeneous* differential equation

$$
L[x] = 0,
$$

then $x^* + x_c$ is also a solution of @eq-first.

:::

The proof of @thm-inhomog is very straightforward.

:::{.proof}

We know that $L[x^*] = f(t)$ and $L[x_c] = 0$. Since $L[x]$ is a *linear operator*, you may expand $L[a + b]$ into $L[a] + L[b]$. Then 

$$
\begin{align}
L[x^* + x_c] &= L[x^*] + L[x_c] \\
&= f(t) + 0 \\
&= f(t)
\end{align}
$$

So $x^* + x_c$ is a solution of @eq-first.

:::

$x^*$ is the *particular integral*, and *x_c* is the complementary function.

:::{.callout-note}

This is very parallel to linear algebra. We started by finding the nullspace of the linear operatox $L$, ie the space of functions for which $L[x] = 0$. Now we find the general transformation $L[x] = f(t)$, similar to $A\textbf{x} = \textbf{b}$. 

Recall the Big Picture

$$
A\left(\textbf{x}_{row} + \textbf{x}_{null}\right) = \textbf{b}_{column}
$$

with this accompanying picture:

![The Four Spaces of a linear transformation](Images/2_Four_Spaces.png)

Every vector in the row space of A corresponds to a particular vector in the column space of A, and the set of solutions to $A\textbf{x} = \textbf{b}$ is that vector plus the nullspace of A. Vectors in the left nullspace of A have no solution to $A\textbf{x} = \textbf{b}$. 

Similarly, there is a family of functions in the nullspace of $L$, the family of solutions to the *homogeneous* differential equation $L[x] = 0$. Each function $f(t)$ on the right hand side corresponds to a particular function in the row space of $L$, which we call the *particular integral* $x^*$. Then the full solution set to $L[x] = f(t)$ is that function plus the nullspace of $L$.

So the question is, how do you find a particular integral?

# Solving a Polynomial RHS

Find the general solution of 

$$
\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + 5 \frac{dx}{dt} - 6x = t^2.
$${#eq-example}

To find the space of complementary functions $x_c$, take the characteristic equation

$$
m^2 + 5*m -6 = 0
$$

with roots $m \in \{ 1, -6 \}$.

The nullspace of $L[x]$ is then 
$$
x(t) = Ae^{t} + Be^{-6t}.
$${#eq-nullspace}

## Finding the particular integral

To find a particular integral, test with the polynomial

$$
x(t) = Pt^2 + Qt + R.
$$

This function is our **trial integral**, which is a "completely arbitrary" choice.

Substituting $x(t)$ into @eq-example gives 

$$
\begin{gather}
2P + 5\left( 2Pt + Q \right) - 6(Pt^2 + Qt + R) = t^2 \\
(-6P)t^2 + (10P -6Q)t + (2P + 5Q -6R) = t^2 \\
\end{gather}
$${eq-polynomial}

Solving @eq-polynomial is fairly straightforward: each of the coefficient terms must equal zero, so we set up a system of linear equations and back-substitute our solutions.

$$
\begin{cases}
-6P &&&=1 \\
10P &-6Q & &= 0 \\
2P &+ 5Q &-6R &= 0 \\
\end{cases}
$$

Solving through back-substitution, $P = -\frac{1}{6}, Q = -\frac{5}{18}, R = -\frac{31}{108}$.

Then the particular integral is 
$$ 
-\frac{1}{6}t^2 -\frac{5}{18}t -\frac{31}{108}.
$$

## The general solution

To find the general solution, we add back in the nullspace of $L[x]$, which we defined in @eq-nullspace:

$$
-\frac{1}{6}t^2 -\frac{5}{18}t -\frac{31}{108} + Ae^{t} + Be^{-6t}.
$$

You can do this with any polynomial RHS - just use the fully general polynomial of the same degree as your test case.
