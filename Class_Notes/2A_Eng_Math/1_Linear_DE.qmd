# Introduction to Differential Equations

There are two main types of differential equations: *Ordinary* and *partial*. Partial differential lequations involve partial derivatives of vectors; ordinary differential equations do not. These are simpler to solve than partial DEs.

In $\frac{df}{dx}$, f is the *dependent variable* and x is the *independent variable*.

The *order* of a differential equation is the degree of the highest derivative occuring in that equation.

## Linear vs Nonlinear

*Linear equations* are those equations in which the **dependent variables and their derivatives** do not occur as products, raised to powers or in nonlinear functions. *Nonlinear equations* are all other equations. 

## Homogeneous and Nonhomogeneous

### How to arrange differential equations

The terms with the *dependent variable* go on the left hand side (ie $x$ in $\frac{dx}{dt}$), and all terms not containing the dependent variable (either terms containing only the independent variable, in this case $t$, or constant terms) go on the right hand side of the equation.

### Determining

When the terms are [arranged properly](1_Linear_DE.qmd#how-to-arrange-differential-equations), then **if the right hand side of the equation is ZERO** then the equation is **homogeneous**. If the right hand side (terms without the dependent variable) is **NONZERO**, then the equation is **nonhomogeneous**.

In other words, each term in a homogeneous differential equation involves a dependent variable or its derivatives.

## Solutions to differential equations

The solutions to differential equations generally comprise a function space, or family of related functions.
