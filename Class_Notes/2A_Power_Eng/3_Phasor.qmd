Last week we looked at DC voltages; this week we look at *AC Voltages*, which take the form of *sinusoids*.

# Complex Numbers and Arithmetic

$$
N_1 = x_1 + j\,y_1 = r\angle \theta
$$

Also remember **Euler's Formula**:
$$
e^{j\theta} = \cos{\theta} + j\sin{\theta}
$$

To convert between the two (from a point $x_1, y_1$ to polar form $A\angle \theta$):

$$
\begin{gather}
A = \sqrt{x_1^2 + y_1^2} \\
\theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{y_1}{x_1}\right)
\end{gather}
$$

Note that although generally we work in *degrees* in electrical engineering, formulas using ie $e^{j\theta}$ have inputs and outputs in radians. The final answer should be in engineering notation: 
$r \angle \theta°$

The rectangular forms are convenient for addition and subtraction, but the polar forms are more convenient for multiplication and division.

$$
\begin{gather}
(x_1 + jy_1) + (x_2 + jy_2) = (x_1 + x_2) + j(y_1 + y_2) \\
(r_1 \angle \theta_1)(r_2 \angle \theta_2) = (r_1r_2)\angle(\theta_1 + \theta_2)
\end{gather}
$$

# Phasors

![The UK power suppply](Images/3_Power_Supply.png)

The UK power supply in a household is a single phase with peak amplitudes of $\pm 325V$ and RMS voltage of $230V$. 

You could model the voltage coming into a city with an RLC circuit:

![Our oversimplified city](Images/3_Simple_model.png)

![Further simplified](Images/3_Simpler_model.png)

The voltage source is sinusoidal: $V_M \sin (\omega t + \phi)$

The current going down both paths equals the current coming out of the source: $I = I_c + I_r$

Ohms law: $I_c = \frac{V_0}{R}$

Capacitance law: $I_c = C\frac{dV0}{dt}

The voltage at the source is equal to the voltage across the inductor and the voltage across the resistor: $V_M \sin (\omega t + \phi) = L\frac{dI}{dt} + V_0$

This creates a second order differential equation:

$$
V_M \sin (\omega t + \phi) = LC\frac{d^2V_0}{dt^2} + \frac{L}{R}\frac{dV0}{dt} + V_0
$$

Kinda nasty. 

## Using complex numbers to represent current

Instead, we represent real signals as the real part of a complex signal $e^{j\theta}$

$$
cos(\theta) = Re(e^{j\theta})
$$

Take our voltage from earlier and represent in terms of our complex signal: 

$$
\begin{align}
V \sin (\omega t + \phi) &= V \cos (\omega t + \phi - \frac{\pi}{2}) \\
&= Re(V e^{j(\omega t + \phi - \frac{\pi}{2})}) \\
&= Re(V e^{j(\omega t)} e^{\phi} e^{-j\frac{\pi}{2}})
\end{align}
$$

This gives us our overall formula:
$$
V_M \sin (\omega t + \phi) = Re(V e^{j(\omega t)} e^{j\phi} e^{-j\frac{\pi}{2}})
$${#eq-phasor}

Don't forget the $j$ s in the exponents!
:::

The complex part rotates around a circle with radius $V$ as time $t$ increases. The real portion of the rotating phasor corresponds to the instantaneous value of the time domain signal.

$e^{j(\omega t)}$ is the time varying component, which marches around the unit circle.

$e^{j\phi} e^{-j\frac{\pi}{2}}$ is a **constant complex vector**, and is the part of the phasor which we're really interested in. We can also throw out the $e^{-j\frac{\pi}{2}}$ term, since it's always the same (sines and cosines are the same if you can choose your reference point; absolute angles are arbitrary, relative angles are important.)

So what *really matters* in steady state analysis is the relative difference in peak voltage $V$ and phase angle $\phi$.

## Phase Shift Between Phasors

Say we have two different sinusoidal voltage curves:

$$
\begin{align}
A(t) &= A_m \sin (\omega t + \phi_A) \\
B(t) &= B_m \sin (\omega t + \phi_B) \\
\end{align}
$$

Then our two phasors are 

$$
\begin{align}
\textbf{A} &= A_m\angle \phi_A \\
\textbf{B} &= B_m\angle \phi_B \\
\end{align}
$$

# Drawing phasor diagrams

Since we only care about steady state values, we usually set one phasor to be the reference phasor lying along the real axis.

## Phasor arithmetic

It often happens in EE that you have phasors offset from each other by 90°, in which case you can simply multiply by $j$ or $-j$.

If you have a voltage that is the sum of several other sinusoidal signals (**of the same frequency**), its phasor representation is given by the sum of the phasors that represent each component sinusoid.

This also holds for subtraction, multiplication and division.

## Example phasor diagram

For this circuit:

![](Images/3_Circuit_example.png)

We could draw the following fictional phasor diagram:

![](Images/3_Phasor_1.png)

By Kirchoff's Current law, $I_C + I_{R_2} + I_L = I_{R_1}$, which we can draw with vector addition:

:::{.callout-warning}
Phasor analysis is only applicable to systems at a constant frequency that approach a steady state. They are not useful for dynamic (nonlinear) systems!

## A Second Example

We start with three sinusoidal signals:

$$
\begin{gather}
A = 150 \angle 30° \\
B = 70 \angle -40° \\
C = 50 \angle 120° \\
\end{gather}
$$

We're going to use **B** as our reference phasor, so the first step is to get all angles relative to B:

$$
\begin{gather}
A = 150 \angle 70° \\
B = 70 \angle 0° \\
C = 50 \angle 160° \\
\end{gather}
$$

Now we graph:
