# Electrical Circuits

## Electrical fields: 

Generated by electric charges, exert forces on other charged particles. 

Electric field strength is the force per unit charge that would be experienced by a test charge at that point.

Newtons / Coulomb.

## Electric Potential:

How much work needs to be done to move a unit charge from one point in an electric field to a reference point (electric field strength is 0)

Measured in Joules per Coulomb (V).

## Voltage: Circuit symbols

Above are 2 methods of denoting a DC circuit. AC circuits can be denoted as such:

![AC source](Images/1_AC_Source.png)

## Reference or Ground

One part of  the circuit is denoted as ground. To refer to other voltages, you refer to the "voltage across X".

## Current

Rate of flow of **positive** electric charges through a conductor (ie the negative rate of electron flow). A voltage induces current flow. 

Unit: Amps ($A$). Current is often denoted by $I$.

## Resistance

Resistance is a measure of the opposition to charge presented by an object.

Ohm's law:

$$
V = IR
$$

## Power dissipation:

Power generated by an object is:

$$
P = VI
$$

$V$ is Joules (J) / Coulomb (Q), and $I$ is Coulombs (Q) / second (S), so power $P$ is Joules (J) /second (S), ie Watts.

Power dissipation in a resistor:

$$
\begin{gather}
P = VI
I = \frac{V}{R}
P = \frac{V^2}{R}
\end{gather}
$$

# Components

## Resistors

A resistor is a passive electrical component with an electrical resistance. The flow of current is equal to some constant times $V$. 

Resistors are used to dissipate heat in a hurry (braking resistors on motors), or to model other components (like voltage lines.)

Resistors can be drawn two ways: *specific*  and *generic*.

## Capacitors

Two conductive surfaces separated by an insulating dielectric. 

The current flow through a capacitor is proportional to the rate of change of voltage across the cap.

$$
I = C \frac{dV}{dt}
$$

$C$ is the capacitance, in Farads.

Capacitors are often used as filters in electrical circuits to prevent the flow of DC current and smooth out spikes.

They play a [very important role](#) in power engineering.

## Inductors

Formed by winding a conductor around a core material (metal, air, steel)

$$
V = L\frac{dI}{dt}
$$

Where $L$ is the inductance, measured in Henrys.

Often used as filters.

## Fuses

Prevent current from passing above a certain amperage (thin wire which melts).

## Use of components

Capacitors, resistors, and inductors are used to develop *models* for larger, more complicated systems.

#  Circuit Analysis

## Kirchoff's Voltage Law:

![Kirchoff's Voltage Illustration](Images/1_Kirchoff_Voltage.png)

> The sum of the voltages around any loop is zero

In other words, the sum of the current gains and the current drops around a loop is zero.

$$
\begin{gather}
V + V_1 + V_2 = 0 \\
V_2 + V_3 + V_4 = 0 \\
V + V_1 + V_3 + V_4 = 0
\end{gather}
$$

## Kirchoff's Current Law:

![Kirchoff's Current Illustration](Images/1_Kirchoff_Current.png)

> The sum of the currents flowing into a node must equal the sum of the currents flowing out of a node

$$
I_1 = I_2 + I_3
$$

These laws take *very well* to analysis through linear algebra.

## Rules for reducing resistances to equivalent resistances:

Resistors in series add together:

![Resistors in series](Images/1_Resistor_Series.png)

$$
R_{eq} = \Sigma_n R_i
$$

Resistors in parallel add like so:

![Resistors in parallel](Images/1_Resistor_Parallel.png)

$$
R_{eq} = \frac{1}{\Sigma_n \frac{1}{R_i}}
$$

When you have a *voltage divider*, the following equation attains:

![Voltage divider](Images/1_Voltage_Divider.png)

$$
V_{out} = V_{in} \frac{R_2}{R_2+R_1}
$$

With these rules, you should be able to take any circuit (made up only of voltage sources and resistors) to its circuit equivalent, with one power source and one resistor:
