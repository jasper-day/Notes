# Drag Coefficient For Body Shapes

Drag coefficient for various body shapes at $Re \approx 10^5$, based on frontal area, except for the inclined plate where $A = L \times W$.

$$
C_D = 2(\textnormal{Drag})/(\rho u^2 A)
$$

$$
F_D = \frac{1}{2}C_D \rho A u^2
$$

Flow is from left to right w.r.t the body shape. $a$ is the body dimension in the direction of flow and $b$ is perpendicular to it.
