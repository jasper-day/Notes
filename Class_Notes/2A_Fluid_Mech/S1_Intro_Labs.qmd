For *1, 3, and 5*, there are no substantial submissions - you have to analyze the data, but you don't have to produce any graphs. 

FM2 labs support the lectures, but they also build your professional skills. 

You have to show:
- Beautiful and effective graphs
- Dealing with uncertainty
- Drawing good conclusions

# Drag Laboratory

Reminder: the [drag force equation](1_2_Flow_Fields.qmd#drag-force-equation) is 

$$
F_D = \frac{1}{2}C_D \rho p A u^2
$$

The point of the lab is to measure the relationship between the drag coefficient and [Reynolds number](1_2_Flow_Fields.qmd#reynolds-number) for a portion of the graph.

$$
Re = \frac{\rho_f u D}{\mu}
$$

Large and fast objects, travelling in low viscosity fluid, have greater Reynolds numbers than the obverse.

We will be dropping small aluminum / plastic spheres down columns of water and oil, recreating a small range of Reynolds numbers.

We know the density and viscosity of the fluid ($\rho_f, \mu$), we know the diameter of the sphere, and we will time the descent of the sphere to find its velocity.

To find the drag force on the sphere, we use this free body diagram.

$$
F_D = F_W - F_B
$$

$F_D$ is the drag force, the unknown we wish to solve. $F_W$ is the mass of the sphere times g, which can be directly measured (or calculated using the density of the sphere), and $F_B$ is the force of buoyancy, which equals $\rho \dot g \dot V$.
