<td class="rowhead1">Summary</td><td colspan="99">The student should develop an awareness of the qualitive behaviour of fluids in typical situations so that models of problems can be set up for solution. The course's objectives are to:<br/>
1.	Produce quantitative solutions for models derived from some useful applications in the fields of measurement and pipe flow;<br/>
2.	Establish enough theoretical background to enable the range of validity of these basic solutions to be understood; and to <br/>
3.	Provide a starting point with respect to terminology and theory for more advanced study in subsequent years.<br/>
