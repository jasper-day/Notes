# Properties of Fluids

When you push on a solid with a shear stress $\tau$, it deforms a certain amount:

![Pushing on a solid block](Images/1_Solid_deformation_1.png)

Double the force on the block, and the deflection $\phi$ doubles:

![Pushing twice as hard](Images/1_Solid_deformation_2.png)

However, when you enact a shear stress on a liquid, it keeps deflecting:

![Pushing on a liquid element](Images/1_Liquid_deformation_1.png)

The *rate of deflection* $\frac{d\phi}{dt}$ doubles when you double the shear stress:

Thus, a fluid deforms continuously when a force is applied. Liquids flow if and only if something creates a shear stress (not perpendicular to the walls of the container). If a liquid is not flowing, then no such shear stresses exist.

# Viscosity

- First property of a fluid.

Note that shear force per unit area ($F/A$) in a solid is the shear *stress*, $\tau$. The shear strain is an angle of deformation $\phi$, which (in the elastic region of deformation) is proportional to shear stress.

In a solid,
$$
\phi \propto \tau
$$

This is Hooke's Law.

In a liquid, the *rate of change of strain* is proportional to the shear stress, ie

$$
\frac{d\phi}{dt} \propto \tau
$$

We put a few symbols around that. For small $\phi$, $\phi \approx \frac{x}{y}$. At the start of the process, y is constant.

$$
\begin{gather}
\frac{\partial\phi}{\partial t} = \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \left( \frac{x}{y} \right) \\
= \frac{1}{y}\frac{\partial x}{\partial t}
\end{gather}
$$

$\frac{\partial x}{partial t}$, the velocity in the $x$ direction, is given its own symbol $u$. Generally, a flow vector $\textbf{u}$ has flow speed components $u, v, w$ in the $x, y, z$ directions respectively.

So $\tau \propto \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t} \propto \frac{u}{y}$. 

Consider the graph of x velocity w.r.t y; there is a certain slope to that graph. The slope of that graph is directly related to viscosity by some constant $\mu$ with units $kg m^{-1} s^{-1}$. We call that constant $\mu$ the **viscosity** of the liquid.

![Low vs high viscosity comparison](Images/1_viscosity_graph.png)

On the left, a fluid with a low viscosity has a high slope (the fluid starts moving quickly as you get away from the wall); a fluid with a high viscosity has a low slope (the fluid moves slowly even a far distance from the wall).

## Newton's Law of Viscosity

$$
\tau = \mu\frac{du}{dy}
$$

There is a linear relationship between the distance from a wall and the rate of flow parallel to that wall.

## Conclusions

Viscosity tells us how easy it is to shear the fluid; a measure of friction within the fluid. Fluids obeying Newton's law are *Newtonian Fluids*: the shear stress is linearly related to the velocity in the fluid (with a slope of $\mu$ as you get further from the wall).

Non-Newtonian fluids have a non-linear relationship between the amount of shear stress and the rate of motion within the fluid. 

Picture the fluid flowing in *layers*, where each layer of the fluid (a plane at a certain distance from the wall) drags the layer of fluid below it along.

Viscosity is usually measured as the force created between two driven plates with a fluid between (or practically, two cylinders with a layer of fluid of known height in between).

At the wall, there is a *no-slip condition*: the fluid sticks to the wall as $u=0$. 

Intuitively, $\mu_{gases} << \mu_{liquids}$

For gases, viscosity increases with temperature due to intermolecular interactions. With liquids, viscosity is caused by intermolecular cohesion, which decreases as temperature increases.

Kinematic viscosity $\frac{\mu}{\rho} = \nu$ is its own thing (unit viscosity per mass density).

# Density

- Second property of the fluid.

Density is *mass* per *unit volume*: $\rho = \frac{m}{V}$.

**Specific Density** is $\frac{\rho}{\rho_{water}}$. Remember that $\rho_{water}$ is 1000 $kg m^{-3}$. 

Flows with negligible variations in $\rho$ are **incompressible** flows; flows in which variations in $\rho$ are non-negligible are **compressible**.

:::{.callout-note}
- All liquid flows may be regarded as incompressible
- Gas flows in which the flow speed **u** is well below the speed of sound ($c_s$) may also be regarded as incompressible.

$\frac{u}{c_s} = M$, the Mach number. Below a Mach number of 0.3, changes in density can be expected to be less than 5%; the flow is incompressible.

# Surface Tension

- Surface tension is the third basic property of a fluid.

Surface tension is a force in the surface of a liquid. Recall that all of the molecules within a liquid attract each other. On the surface of the liquid, there are internal molecules on one side of the surface and none on the other. Therefore, there is a net intermolecular force on the molecules at the surface.

![Surface molecules experiencing a net force](Images/1_surface_tension.png)

Surface tension $\sigma$ is defined as the force in a liquid's surface along a line of unit length in the surface. Since it's defined as the force divided along a line, it has units $kg s^{-2}$. 

Surface tension *decreases* with temperature, as IMFs decrease.

Surface tension forces are often small & neglected; but they may dominate when dealing with droplets or bubbles.
