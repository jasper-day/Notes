# Properties of Fluids

When you push on a solid with a shear stress $\tau$, it deforms a certain amount:

Double the force on the block, and the deflection $\phi$ doubles:

However, when you enact a shear stress on a liquid, it keeps deflecting:

The *rate of deflection* $\frac{d\phi}{dt}$ doubles when you double the shear stress:

Thus, a fluid deforms continuously when a force is applied. Liquids flow if and only if something creates a shear stress (not perpendicular to the walls of the container). If a liquid is not flowing, then no such shear stresses exist.
