# Laminar Flow

![Laminar flow](Images/1_2_Laminar_Flow.png)

Laminar flow has smooth fluid motion in "layers" (laminae). 

Reynold's experiment (after 19th centure Manchester professor). The experiment involves creating *dye lines* at different flow speeds. With a low flow speed, the dye line is straight and parallel, and remains clearly defined through the length of the pipe. With a faster flow speed, the dye line starts to break up and eventually engages in runaway disturbances (turbulent state): the dye line breaks up into a *myriad of entangled threads*. 

The transition from *laminar* to *turbulent* flow is quite abrupt.

# Turbulent Flow

There is still a net flow, but now there's a lot of 3d random motion as well, which creates a very unstable regime.

# Reynolds number

$$
Re \equiv \frac{\rho u D}{\mu}
$$

Ratio of the *inertial*, or *disturbing* forces ($\rho$, $u$, $D$) to the [viscous](1_Introduction.qmd#viscosity) forces ($\mu$).

For flow in a pipe:
- Re < $\approx$ 2000 creates *laminar* flow (if undisturbed)
- Re > $\approx$ 4000 creates *turbulent* flow
- 2000 < Re < 4000 is *transitional* flow: it could be either laminar or turbulent, but you can't tell from the Reynold's number alone.

At a low Re, viscous forces dominate. At high Re, viscous forces become negligible.

These numbers *only* apply for flow in a pipe. Other values must be taken for other flow situations.

# Flow in a pipe

Near the walls of the pipe, the fluid *shears* and the velocity drops. This is the *boundary layer*. At the walls, you have the *no-slip* condition from earlier. In the boundary layer, viscous effects dominate.

 The boundary layer thickness ($\delta$) is greater for more viscous fluids, lesser with higher flow rates, and increases as you move down the pipe.

 The variation of $u$ (flow speed) with the cross-duct position $y$ is the *velocity profile* $u(y)$.

With laminar flow, $u(y)$ creates a *parabola*.

With turbulent flow, between the boundary layers, there is a roughly flat profile. The fluid within the pipe is mixed, and the momentum of the fluid is evenly distributed beyond the boundary layer.

An **ideal fluid** is *incompressible* and *inviscid*, ie has no viscosity. Since there's no shearing, the flow in the pipe is uniform with respect to $y$.
