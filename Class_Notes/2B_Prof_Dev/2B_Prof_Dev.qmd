<td class="rowhead1">Summary</td><td colspan="99">This course is designed to support Engineering students to develop skills in professional ethics that will provide a foundation for a successful future career as a professional engineer.  The course will use a combination of real case studies, ethical reasoning, and example problems to provide students with a range of tools and resources to allow them to develop their skills to investigate, analyse and make decisions about ideas related to their professional ethical development.</td>

<td class="rowhead1">Course description</td><td colspan="99">
    
    "Knowing engineering ethics is as much a part of knowing how to engineer as knowing how to calculate stress or design a circuit is". One of the most important aspects in the career of a professional engineer is being in the position to make and influence important decisions often with create potential for significant societal implications. This course will cover the theoretical background to professional ethics in an engineering context. Activities will include analysis of examples from key sectors where engineers work, investigation of ethics applied in engineering contexts. Seminar sessions will be used in conjunction with formally delivered content to allow a blend of individual work and group discussion.
