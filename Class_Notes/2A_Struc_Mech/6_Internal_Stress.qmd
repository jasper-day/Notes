# Euler Beam Theory of Pure Bending

Bending stress:

$$
\sigma_z = E\kappa y
$$

# Geometry of the Cross-Section

The position of the centroid $y_G$ is given by
$$
y_G = \frac{\int_A y' dA}{\int_A dA}
$$

The second moment of area is given by
$$
I_{xx} = \int_A y^2 dA
$$

This tells you the distribution of area with respect to the centroid.

## Neutral Axis

The neutral axis of a beam is the line along which there is no tension or compression in the fibers of the beam.

# Relationship between Bending Stress and Bending Moment

$$
\left.
\begin{matrix}
\sigma &= E \kappa y \\
M &= EI\kappa
\end{matrix}\,
\right\}
$$

Therefore 
$$
\sigma = \frac{y}{i}M \textnormal{or} M = \frac{I}{y}\sigma
$$

from which we create the section modulus $Z_t = I/y$.
