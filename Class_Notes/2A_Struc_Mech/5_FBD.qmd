To create a free body diagram of internal stresses, place a cut somewhere in the structure and draw the forces acting on either side of the cut.

## Convention for Internal Forces

### Axial Force

![](Images/5_Tension.png)

Symbol: **$N$**

*Tension* is positive

### Shear Force

![](Images/5_Shear.png)

Symbol: **$V$**

*Clockwise* is positive. Shear comes in a [couple](3_Static_Equilibrium.qmd#couple).

### Bending moment

![](Images/5_Moment.png)

Symbol: **$M$**

*Sagging* is positive. In sagging, there is compression at the top of the beam and tension at the bottom, and in *hogging* those forces are reversed.

Remember, sagging is happy (positive) and hogging is sad (negative)

# Diagramming Shear and Moment

A plot of the shear forces along a beam is a *shear force diagram*; a plot of the bending moments with respect to $x$ is called a *bending moment diagram*.

## Example 1:

![](Images/5_Example_Diagram.png)

We set up our five equilibrium equations:

$$
\begin{align}
\Sigma F_H = 0 &\Rightarrow H_A = 0 \\
\Sigma F_V = 0 &\Rightarrow R_A = P \\
\Sigma M = 0 &\Rightarrow M_A = P\,L
\end{align}
$$

To find the *internal* stresses, we cut the beam at anny coordinate $z$ an d determine the internal stress resultants $N(z), V(z),$ and $M(z)$ at that point.

![](Images/5_Diagram_Cut.png)

We set up the same equations again (taking the sum of moments *at the point of the cut*):

$$
\begin{align}
\Sigma F_H = 0 \hspace{2em} &\Rightarrow H_A = N(z) \hspace{2em} \Rightarrow N(z) = 0 \\
\Sigma F_V = 0 \hspace{2em} &\Rightarrow R_A = V(z) \\
\Sigma M_z = 0 \hspace{2em} &\Rightarrow M(z) = M_A - R_A \, z
\end{align}
$$

That last moment equation further simplifies:

$$
\begin{gather}
M(z) + M_A - R_A\,z = 0 \\
M(z) + P\,L - P\,z = 0 \\
\therefore M(z) = P(z-l)
$$

### Shear Force Diagram

![](Images/5_Shear_Diagram.png)

Since $V$ is unchanging with $z$, this graph is a straight line.

### Bending Moment Diagram

![](Images/5_Moment_Diagram.png)

We go from $-P/L$ at $z = 0$ to 0 at $z = l$. The moment starts negative and goes to zero; this means that the beam is hogging *less and less* over its length.

## Bending Moment in a Beam 

![Bending moment in a beam as a result of an applied shear force](Images/5_Bending_Moment_Beam.png)

Note that the shear force at a point is the derivative of the bending moment at the same point.

# Shear Force under a uniformly distributed load:

Here is our setup:

![](Images/5_Distributed.png)

Let $l$ be the length of the rod.

:::{.callout-note}

An  *equally distributed force* creates a moment acting about the point halfway across the distributed load.

:::

We set up our global equilibrium equations:

$$
\begin{align}
\Sigma F_H = 0 \hspace{2em} &\Rightarrow H_A = 0 \\
\Sigma F_V = 0 \hspace{2em} &\Rightarrow R_A + R_B = \omega \, l \\
\Sigma M_z = 0 \hspace{2em} &\Rightarrow R_B \, l - \omega \, \frac{l}{2} = 0
\end{align}
$$

So $R_B$ is equal to $R_A$ is equal to $\omega \, l /2$. 

Now cut the beam at an arbitrary point $z$:

![](Images/5_Distributed_Cut.png)

The moment and shear forces can be found simply through the same equilibrium equations:

$$
\begin{gather}
V + \omega z - R_A = 0 \\
\Rightarrow V = \frac{\omega l}{2} - \omega z = \omega \left( \frac{l}{2} - z
 \right) \\
M(z) = R_A z - \omega z \frac{z}{2} = \frac{\omega}{2} (l - z)z
\end{gather}
$$

So our shear diagram has a negative slope from $\omega l / 2$ to $-\omega l / 2$ across the length of the beam, and the bending moment diagram is a parabola from 0 to 0 with a peak (halfway across) of $\omega l / 8$.

# M = $\frac{d}{dl}$ V

Imagine a beam with some load function $\omega(z)$. Take a differential element at some $z$:

![](Images/5_Differential_Element.png)

Set up some differential equations *for the forces acting across the differential element* (recall that $\omega$ is a *distributed load* acting across the length $dz$ of the differential element!)

$$
\begin{gather}
V - (V + dV) - \omega dz = 0 \\
\Rightarrow \frac{dV}{dz} = -\omega
\end{gather}
$$

Now examine the bending moment (take the bending moment around point $z + dz$):

$$
\begin{gather}
-M - Vdz + M + dM + \omega dz \frac{dz}{2} = 0 \\
V = \frac{dM}{dz} + \frac{\omega dz}{2}
\end{gather}
$$

Now take the limit as $z\to 0$:

$$
\begin{gather}
\lim_{z \to 0} \frac{dM}{dz} + \frac{\omega dz}{2} = \lim_{z \to 0} \frac{dM}{dz} + \lim_{z \to 0}\frac{\omega dz}{2} \\
\lim_{z \to 0} \frac{dM}{dz} = \frac{dM}{dz} \\
\lim_{z \to 0}\frac{\omega dz}{2} = 0 \\
\therefore \lim_{z \to 0} \frac{dM}{dz} + \frac{\omega dz}{2} = \frac{dM}{dz} \\
\end{gather}
$$

Therefore the bending moment with respect to $z$ is the **derivative** of the shear force with respect to $z$ at a point.
