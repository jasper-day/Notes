To create a free body diagram of internal stresses, place a cut somewhere in the structure and draw the forces acting on either side of the cut.

## Convention for Internal Forces

### Axial Force

![](Images/5_Tension.png)

Symbol: **$N$**

*Tension* is positive

### Shear Force

![](Images/5_Shear.png)

Symbol: **$V$**

*Clockwise* is positive. Shear comes in a [couple](3_Static_Equilibrium.qmd#couple).

### Bending moment

Symbol: **$M$**

*Sagging* is positive. In sagging, there is compression at the top of the beam and tension at the bottom, and in *hogging* those forces are reversed.

Remember, sagging is happy (positive) and hogging is sad (negative)

# Diagramming Shear and Moment

A plot of the shear forces along a beam is a *shear force diagram*; a plot of the bending moments with respect to $x$ is called a *bending moment diagram*.

## Example 1:

![](Images/5_Example_Diagram.png)

We set up our five equilibrium equations:

$$
\begin{align}
\Sigma F_H = 0 &\Rightarrow H_A = 0 \\
\Sigma F_V = 0 &\Rightarrow R_A = P \\
\Sigma M = 0 &\Rightarrow M_A = P\,L
\end{align}
$$

To find the *internal* stresses, we cut the beam at anny coordinate $z$ an d determine the internal stress resultants $N(z), V(z),$ and $M(z)$ at that point.

We set up the same equations again (taking the sum of moments *at the point of the cut*):

$$
\begin{align}
\Sigma F_H = 0 \hspace{2em} &\Rightarrow H_A = N(z) \hspace{2em} \Rightarrow N(z) = 0 \\
\Sigma F_V = 0 \hspace{2em} &\Rightarrow R_A = V(z) \\
\Sigma M_z = 0 \hspace{2em} &\Rightarrow M(z) = M_A - R_A \, z
\end{align}
$$

That last moment equation further simplifies:

$$
\begin{gather}
M(z) + M_A - R_A\,z = 0 \\
M(z) + P\,L - P\,z = 0 \\
\therefore M(z) = P(z-l)
$$

### Shear Force Diagram

Since $V$ is unchanging with $z$, this graph is a straight line.

### Bending Moment Diagram

![](Images/5_Moment_Diagram.png)

We go from $-P/L$ at $z = 0$ to 0 at $z = l$. The moment starts negative and goes to zero; this means that the beam is hogging *less and less* over its length.

## Bending Moment in a Beam

Note that the shear force at a point is the derivative of the bending moment at the same point.
