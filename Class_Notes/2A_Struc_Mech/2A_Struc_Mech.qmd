## Summary

This course engages students with the fundamental principles of Structural Mechanics relevant to civil and mechanical engineers. Specific topics including: equilibrium, stress, strain, axial load, torsion, bending, shear, and deflections in structural elements including beams, columns, struts, ties, and trusses.

Tutorials:
- 9 'Tutorials' (Format to be decided)

Come in with whatever things you had the most trouble with.

Laboratory experiments:

- 4-6 'Physical Experiments/Demonstrations' (Format to be decided)

The truss lab is completed online.

All labs are completed *before* the relevant theory is taught. The point is foremost data collection.

Think about *sources of error*.

The report should wind up about 6 pages long (1.5 pages per experiment).

## Total Hours: 100

- Lecture Hours 18,
- Seminar/Tutorial Hours 9,
- Supervised Practical/Workshop/Studio Hours 3,
- Online Activities 0.5,
- Summative Assessment Hours 1.5,
- Programme Level Learning and Teaching Hours 2,
- Directed Learning and Independent Learning Hours 66

## Assessment
- Written exam 80 %
- Coursework 20 %
- Practical Exam 0 %

Note that the coursework is all *one submission*, which is intended to have been completed over the course of the course.

## Learning Outcome

1. Describe and manipulate fundamental concepts of stress, strain, and deformation in members carrying axial, bending, shear, and torsional loads; 
2. Determine how statically determinate trusses and beams carry load; for beams using diagrams of bending moment and shear force, and evaluate the resulting elastic deflections of the beams;
3. Analyse structural cross sections, so as to determine the elastic stress and strain distributions, as well as the deformations, resulting from axial, bending and torsional actions;
4. Describe and manipulate relevant concepts of combined loadings and stress and strain transformation.
