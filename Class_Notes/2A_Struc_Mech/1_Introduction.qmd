Structures are everywhere, if you care to notice them.

# What is a structure?

- Assembly of different types of (structural) members
- Carries loads & transmits forces through its members
- Functional
    - Buildings
    - Bridges
    - Dams
    - Tunnels
    - Rockets......

Structural design is about the selection of safe and effective structural forms. The use of materials is determined by *stresses* and *deformations* under design loads. It's analysed through structural mechanics and structural analysis.

# Structural Members

## Struts and ties

Only transmit axial forces (compression and tension), do not transmit bending forces.

:::{.callout-note}
Of course everything acts in bending, etc. In real life, nothing is *only* submitted to axial forces. But we take the situation where the main function of the member is to resist axial forces.

Struts are drawn with a single thin line:

## Trusses

An assembly of struts and ties (bars) providing a stiff frame with efficient use of material.

Efficient in use of material, strong and stiff. Many bridges are truss bridges; see the Forth road bridge.

## Beams

Members also subjected to bending moments and shear forces. Drawn with a slightly thicker line.

## Columns

Resist compressive axial force. Often found in buildings.

## Shafts

Only subject to torsion, not compression or tension.

## Arches

Structures curved in the vertical plane. Any load is transmitted directly into the ground; the whole structure is in compression (very strong). May be built from loose bricks.

Domes are 3D arches. (solid of revolution)

## Plates and slabs

A two dimensional beam which gives a complete floor. Plates are metal, slabs are concrete.

## Shells and pressure vessels

3D curved thin structures, usuallyl for storing things and building stiff and strong structures. The airframe of a rocket is an example of a shell.

## Supports

Set the *boundary conditions* for the structures.

### Pinned support

1 degree of freedom. Does not support translations; only rotations are allowed.

![Pinned support](Images/1_Pin_Sup.png)

### Roller support

2 degrees of freedom. Supports translation in the direction of the roller as well as spin.

![Roller support](Images/1_Roller.png)

### Fixed support

No degrees of freedom.

# Representing structures

Done through *structural diagrams*.

Relevant information:

- Geometry
- Type of member, type of material
- Sources of load


![Joints](Images/1_Joints.png)

Joints are free to rotate.

![Forces](Images/1_Force.png)

Forces would cause translations in a system outside of equilibrium. Act on a point.

![Moments](Images/1_Moment.png)

Moments would cause rotations in a system out of equilibrium. Act on a point.

![Distributed loads](Images/1_Dist_Load.png)

Forces spread out across an area.
