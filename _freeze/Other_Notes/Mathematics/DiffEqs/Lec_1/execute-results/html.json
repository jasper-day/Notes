What do you do when you meet one?\n\n# What to do when you meet a nasty ODE\n\n## The Geometric View of Differential Equations\n\nOn the one hand, you have the *analytic* method of solving a differential equation:\n\nAnalytic method\n\n:   Start with a differential equation $y' = f(x,y)$, then find solutions $y_1$, $y_2$...\n\nThe geometric view starts with a *Direction field* and results in an *integral curve*. \n\nYou fill the plane with points $(x,y)$, each of which has an infinitesimal line element with the slope $f(x,y)$. The integral curve is a curve starting from a particular plane, and which is tangent to every line element at every slope. The integral curve *has the direction of the field everywhere at all points*.\n\n::: {#thm-geom}\n\n## Integral Curve\n\n$y_1(x)$ is a solution to $y'=f(x,y)$ **if and only if** the graph of $y_1(x)$ is an integral curve of the direction field associated with $y'=f(x,y)$.\n\n:::\n\nFor $y_1(x)$ to be a solution to $y'=f(x,y)$, then $y_1'(x)$ must equal $f(x, y_1(x))$ for all $x$. \n\nFor the graph of $y_1(x)$ to be an integral curve of the direction field associated with $y'=f(x,y)$, the slope of $y_1(x)$ must equal the slope of the direction field $f(x, y_1(x))$ for all $x$. \n\nClearly if one statement attains, then both must attain!\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=1}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=2}\n![An example of a direction field](Lec_1_files/figure-html/fig-vecfield-output-1.svg){#fig-vecfield}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nHere's the same direction field with an integral curve on top:\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=2}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=3}\n![The direction field with an integral curve](Lec_1_files/figure-html/fig-intcurve-output-1.svg){#fig-intcurve}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n",
