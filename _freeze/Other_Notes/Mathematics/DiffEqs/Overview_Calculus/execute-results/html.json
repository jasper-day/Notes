Again, linear, constant coefficients... but several variables at once.\n\nWe will need *eigenvalues* and *eigenvectors* to turn the $n$ coupled equations into $n$ *uncoupled* equations that we can solve separately.\n\n## Numerical Analysis\n\nGenerally, solutions are found numerically, and there's a lot to learn about exactly how that's done. MATLAB is a first-class package (lol) that gives you lots of equations to solve differential equations.\n\n**ODE45**: **O**rdinary **D**ifferential **E**quations 45.\n\nEuler came up with the first numerical method for calculating differential equations; his solution was fine but not sufficiently accurate - ODE45 has much higher accuracy and higher flexibility.\n\n\n## Partial Differential Equations\n\n$$\n\\frac{du}{dx} = \\frac{d^2u}{dx^2}\n$${#eq-heat}\n\nHere we have 2 variables: time and $x$, in the space direction. @eq-heat is the *heat equation.*\n\n$$\n\\frac{d^2u}{dt^2} = \\frac{d^2u}{dx^2}\n$${#eq-wave}\n\n@eq-wave is the *wave equation*. @eq-heat and @eq-wave are both infinite systems of equations in space and time.\n\n$$\n\\frac{d^2u}{dx^2} + \\frac{d^2u}{dx^2} = 0\n$${#eq-laplace}\n\n@eq-laplace is the *Laplace equation.*\n\n## Goal\n\nGet a *standard, clear picture* of the basic differential equations that we can solve and understand.\n\n# The calculus you need\n\n## Important Derivatives:\n\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dx}x^n = nx^{n-1}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{d}{dx}(\\sin{x}) &= \\cos{x} \\\\\n\\frac{d}{dx}(\\cos{x}) &= -\\sin{x} \n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dx}e^x = e^x\n$$\n\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dx}\\ln{x} = \\frac{1}{x}\n$$\n\n## Derivative Rules:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dx}(f + g) = \\frac{d}{dx}f + \\frac{d}{dx}g\n$$\n\nThe product rule (@eq-prod):\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dx}(fg) = g\\frac{df}{dx} + f\\frac{dg}{dx}\n$${#eq-prod}\n\nThe quotient rule (@eq-quot)^[Easily remembered by taking the product rule on $f$ and $\\frac{1}{g}$]:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\frac{f}{g}\\right) = \\frac{g\\frac{df}{dx}-f\\frac{dg}{dx}}{g^2}\n$${#eq-quot}\n\nAnd the all-important chain rule (@eq-chain):\n\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dx}\\left(f(g)\\right) = \\frac{df}{dg}\\frac{dg}{dx}= g'(f) \\cdot f'\n$${#eq-chain}\n\nLast, the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (@eq-fund):\n\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dx} \\int_0^xy(t)dt = y(x)\n$${#eq-fund}\n\nYou take a function, you integrate it, you take the derivative, you get it back.\n\n## Applying the Fundamental Theorem:\n\n$$\ny(t) = \\int_0^te^{t-s}q(s)ds \\hspace{2em} \\text{solves} \\hspace{2em} \\frac{dy}{dt} = y + q(t)\n$${#eq-app}\n\nWe want to show that @eq-first-1 is solved by the integral in @eq-app.\n\nLet's take the derivative of the integral:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\ny(t) &= \\int_0^te^{t-s}q(s)ds \\\\\n\\frac{dy}{dt} &= \\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\int_0^t e^{t-s}q(s)ds\\right) \\\\\n&= \\frac{d}{dt}\\left(e^t\\int_0^t e^{-s}q(s)ds\\right) \\\\\n&= e^t\\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\int_0^t e^{-s}q(s)ds\\right) \n    + \\frac{de^t}{dt}\\left(\\int_0^t e^{-s}q(s)ds\\right)\\\\\n&= e^t\\left(e^{-t} q(t) \\right) + e^t\\left(\\int_0^t e^{-s}q(s)ds\\right)\\\\\n&= q(t) + \\int_0^te^{t-s}q(s)ds\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTherefore:\n$$\n\\frac{dy}{dt} = y(t) + q(t)\n$$\n\nAnd @eq-first-1 is satisfied. \n\n## The Taylor Series\n\nTangent line to a graph:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nf(t + \\Delta t) &\\approx f(t) + \\Delta t \\frac{df}{dt}(t)\\\\\n\\frac{\\Delta f}{\\Delta t} &\\approx \\frac{df}{dt}\n\\end{aligned}\n$${#eq-diff-calc}\n\n@eq-diff-calc expresses the most fundamental idea of differential calculus. At the point $t$, the derivative $\\frac{df}{dt}$ is *very close* to the change in the function over a short distance $\\Delta t$.\n\nHence, on the graph of e(t):\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=1}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=2}\n![](Overview_Calculus_files/figure-html/cell-2-output-1.svg){}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nSince $\\frac{d}{dt}\\left(e^x\\right) = e^x$, the slope of the tangent line at any point along the graph is the *height of the graph at that point.*\n\nWe can get closer to our function if, instead of a tangent line, we use a tangent *parabola*:\n\n$$\nf(t + \\Delta t) \\approx \\frac{df}{dt} + \\frac{1}{2!}(\\Delta t)^2\\frac{df^2}{dt^2}\n$$\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=2}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=3}\n![](Overview_Calculus_files/figure-html/cell-3-output-1.svg){}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nYou can see that the tangent parabola approximates $e^x$ much better than the tangent line does.\n\nTo do better, we could take the third derivative, the fourth derivative, etc... and when we're done, we get $e^t$. \n\nThis leads us to the *Taylor Series*:\n\n$$\nf(x) = \\sum_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n!}(\\Delta t)^n \\frac{d^n f}{dt^n}\n$${#eq-taylor-series}\n\n",
